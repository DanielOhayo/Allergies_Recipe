Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon instant coffee powder (optional)
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup boiling water

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350Â°F and prepare two 9-inch round cake pans by lining the bottoms with parchment paper and greasing the sides.

2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and instant coffee (if using).

3. In a separate medium mixing bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth and well-combined.

4. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking constantly until the batter is smooth and well-mixed.

5. Carefully stir in the boiling water until the batter is smooth and well-combined.

6. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans, and smooth out the tops with a spatula.

7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean.

8. Let the cakes cool completely in their pans before removing and frosting as desired.
