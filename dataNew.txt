Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 Tbsp. sugar
- 1 tsp. active dry yeast
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 2 Tbsp. olive oil

Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, salt, and sugar.

2. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the yeast and warm water. Let sit for 5 minutes or until the yeast has activated and become frothy.

3. Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture. Add the olive oil and stir until well combined. The dough will be sticky.

4. Cover the mixing bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free area for 30 minutes.

5. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.

6. Once the dough has risen, sprinkle some gluten-free flour on a flat surface and transfer the dough to it. Use your hands to shape the dough into a round shape, about 1/4 inch thick.

7. Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

8. Add your desired toppings to the pizza.

9. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted.

10. Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

Enjoy your gluten-free pizza!
