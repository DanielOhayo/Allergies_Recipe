Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups of gluten-free flour mix (can be found at any grocery stores)
- 1/4 cup of almond flour
- 2 teaspoons of baking powder
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup of warm water

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 425Â°F.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour mix, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, and warm water.

4. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and mix well until a dough forms.

5. Place the dough on a greased baking sheet or a piece of parchment paper. With wet hands, shape the dough into a round shape about 10-12 inches in diameter.

6. Bake the crust for 10-12 minutes until it's slightly browned.

7. Once the crust is done, remove it from the oven and add your desired toppings. Bake for an additional 10-12 minutes until the cheese is melted and the toppings are cooked.

8. Slice and serve hot.
