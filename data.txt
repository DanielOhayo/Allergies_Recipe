Of course, I'd be happy to help! Here's a recipe for a moist and delicious chocolate cake:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup boiling water

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans or one 13x9 inch baking pan.

2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

3. Add the milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed with an electric mixer for about two minutes until well-combined.

4. Stir in the boiling water until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's what you want.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes (for round pans) or 35-40 minutes (for a 13x9 inch pan) until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

6. Remove from the oven and allow the cake(s) to cool completely in the pans on a wire rack. Once cool, remove from the pans and frost with your favorite frosting.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!
