Of course, I can help you with that! Here's a recipe for a delicious homemade orange cake:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (about 3-4 oranges)
- Zest of 2 oranges
- 1/2 cup buttermilk

For the orange glaze:
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
- Zest of 1 orange

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.

2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this dry mixture aside.

3. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

4. Combine the orange juice and orange zest in another bowl. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the orange juice mixture. Begin and end with the dry ingredients.

5. Finally, add the buttermilk to the batter and mix until fully incorporated.

6. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula.

7. Bake for approximately 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

8. While the cake is baking, prepare the orange glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, orange juice, and orange zest until smooth.

9. Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then transfer the cake to a wire rack and let it cool completely.

10. Pour the orange glaze over the cooled cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. You can also decorate the top with additional orange zest for an extra pop of flavor.

Your homemade orange cake is now ready to be enjoyed!
